Hello!  This is my Phase 1 project for the Flatiron School.  Please understand that I am just learning to code, so I am always looking for feedback!
Here is the idea of my project:  I want to create a simple app that will generate a Chuck Norris quote, based on certain criteria.  I was inspired to create this when I discovered the free API of Chuck Norris quotes, https://api.chucknorris.io/.  
In addtion, I added a space for the user to come up with their own Chuck Norris jokes.  I would like to add functionality to store these jokes at a later date.
At the bottom of the page, there is a humorous feedback form, created as a list of radio buttons, for users to give me feedback on my website, complete with my feedback on their feedback...
//DISCLAIMER:  Please understand that the api.chucknorris.io website is for comedic purposes only, and is not to be taken seriously.
